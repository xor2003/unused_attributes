# Unused attributes

This utility identifies attributes in Python objects that have been assigned a value but are never accessed or read.

Use this utility with your main file as first argument:

    unused_attributes.py <tartget_script.py>

During runtime, it is recommended to thoroughly test your program, ensuring that all parts of the code are executed. 

Upon program exit, the utility will print the results indicating the usage status of the attributes.
